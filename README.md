# IBM-Data-Analysis-with-R
All data analysis starts with a problem that you need to solve and understanding your data and the types of questions you can answer about it are key aspects of this. The R programming language provides you with all the tools you need to conduct powerful data analysis, providing the conduit between your data and the real-world problems you want to solve. In this module, you’ll review a type of problem that you can solve in R and the underlying data that forms the basis for your analysis. You’ll also learn about the R packages for data analysis, which provide a powerful set of tools that you’re likely to use in everyday data analyses. Finally, you’ll see how to import data and gain basic insights from the dataset.
